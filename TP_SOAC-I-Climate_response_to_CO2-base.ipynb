Direct measurement of atmospheric CO$_2$ started in 1959 (with Keeling in Revelle at Mona Loa). Data before this year are derived from paleo-climatic data like ice-core and other indirect evidences. Compare to atmospheric CO$_2$ , anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions are pretty well known since they are estimated from human/commercial/energetical activity. They are collected by various institute and countries since decades. This emissions data are available on the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC).
